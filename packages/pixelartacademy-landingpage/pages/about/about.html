              This is a highly ambitious project, 7 years in the making with many more to come to realize the full

              available as an open alpha to anyone who pre-orders

              Purchasing Adventure Mode happens in-game as part of the gameplay. It costs $10–$40 and will include a

              Given how long the full development of Adventure Mode will take, I wanted to take the already finished
              learning parts and offer them as a standalone, downloadable game. Learn Mode enables me to create more
              educational content quickly and will be the first to get new updates before they are eventually integrated
              into Adventure Mode.
            </p>
            <p class="purchasing">
              Learn Mode is included when purchasing Adventure Mode so consider if that option works better for you
              than purchasing directly on Steam.

        <div class="paragraphs-block">
          <p>
            The idea for a pixel art game about learning how to draw started in 2015 as I was applying to the
            <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/ldt" target="_blank">Learning, Design, and Technology</a>
            Master's degree program at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Following a successful
            <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/retronator/retronator-pixel-art-academy/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>,
            I completed the game's initial design and prototype as my graduation project and started full-time development
            at the end of 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my research, I realized it's not just access to learning materials that is holding people back from
            realizing their aspirations. Especially for adults, committing and following through with their plans is
            hard when our time competes with other forms of entertainment and life's challenges. My thesis was that if
            we can become invested in our learning as easily as we do in video games, it would help people improve their
            skills with less effort. This led me to focus on developing a rich world where you create your character and
            shape their story as you learn alongside them.

            However, this proved to be a monumental task as a mostly solo developer. I had to learn a lot about how
            to focus the production while also navigating a part-time job running a physical school for game development.
            Even though the game had many alpha releases along the way and the players could see the potential, the full
            vision was too far away for sustainable development.
          </p>
          <p>
            7 years in, I took a step back to see how things could have been done better if I had the chance
            to do it all over again. I concluded that I should have developed the free learning materials first, the
            interactive tutorials second, and the story-rich world last. While I couldn't rewind time, I
            changed course there and then. The game was split into the free
            <a href="{{routerPath 'PixelArtAcademy.StudyGuide.Pages.Home'}}" target="_blank">Study Guide</a>,
            the focused
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2330360/Pixel_Art_Academy_Learn_Mode" target="_blank">Learn Mode</a>,
            and the overarching
            <a href="{{routerPath 'PixelArtAcademy.Adventure' parameter1='adventure-mode'}}" target="_blank">Adventure Mode</a>.
          </p>

            After 1½ years of working on the standalone, downloadable Pixel Art Academy: Learn Mode, it is now ready to
            enter Early Access on Steam. It took many turns to get here but I did my best with the knowledge I had at
            the time, and most importantly, never gave up.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many ways, the Early Access release of Learn Mode is just the beginning. The development continues with adding
            new content for the full release, covering all pixel art fundamentals and the 7 elements of art. I'm sure I
            will take a couple of more wrong turns to get there, but hopefully all the right ones too.
