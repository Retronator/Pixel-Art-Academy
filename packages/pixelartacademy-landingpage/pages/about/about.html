              This is a highly ambitious project, 7 years in the making with many more to come to realize the full

              —is available as an open alpha to anyone who pre-orders
              the game. It is played directly in the browser through a text interface, with ambitions to become a

              Given how long the full development of Adventure Mode will take, I wanted to take the already finished
              learning parts and offer them as a standalone, downloadable game. Learn Mode enables me to create more
              educational content quickly and will be the first to get new updates before they are eventually integrated
              into Adventure Mode.

            <p class="purchasing">
              You will also get Learn Mode when purchasing Adventure Mode so consider if that option works better for you

        <div class="paragraphs-block">
          <p>
            The idea for a pixel art game about learning pixel art started in 2015 as I was applying to the
            <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/ldt" target="_blank">Learning, Design, and Technology</a>
            Master's degree program at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Following a successful
            <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/retronator/retronator-pixel-art-academy/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>,
            I completed the game's initial design and prototype as my graduation project and started full-time development
            at the end of 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my research, I realized it's not just access to learning materials that is holding people back from
            realizing their aspirations. Especially for adults, committing and following through is hard when our time
            competes with other forms of entertainment and life's challenges. My thesis was that if we become invested in
            our learning as easily as we do with other video games, this would help people improve their skills without
            much effort. I set out to develop a rich world where you create your character and acquire skills as well as
            learn how to learn.

            However, this proved to be a monumental task as a mostly solo developer. I had to learn a lot myself about how
            to focus the production while also navigating a part-time job running a physical school for game development.
            Even though the game had many alpha releases along the way and the players could see the potential, the full
            vision was too far away for sustainable development.
          </p>
          <p>
            7 years into development, I took a step back to see how things could have been done better if I had the chance
            to do it all over again. I concluded that I should have developed the free learning materials first, the
            interactive tutorials second, and the story-rich world around it last. While I couldn't rewind time, I did
            change course there and then. The game was split into the free Study Guide, the focused Learn Mode, and the
            overarching Adventure Mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 1 and a half years of working on the standalone, downloadable version of Pixel Art Academy, Learn Mode is
            ready to enter Early Access on Steam. It took many turns to get here but I did my best with the knowledge I
            had at the time, and most importantly I never gave up.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many ways, the Early Access release of Learn Mode is just the start. The development continues with adding
            new content for the full release, covering all pixel art fundamentals and the 7 elements of art. I'm sure it
            will take a couple of more wrong turns to get there, but hopefully all the right ones too.

            While almost everything in the game is designed, drawn, and coded by me, the game would not be as great if I
