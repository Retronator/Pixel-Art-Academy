        <h2>Commitment-based admissions</h2>
        <p>
          You might be used to only top students getting accepted. But what is top anyway?
          At Retropolis Academy of Art, eveyone has the same shot, regardless of experience level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applying to the Academy has two requirements:
        </p>
        <ol class="requirements">
          <li class="requirement">
            <h3 class="title">Identify with Retropolis Code of Behavior</h3>
            <p>
              Studying on campus means living in Retropolis, and living in Retropolis means sharing our values.
              What comes as second nature to people born here might be foreign to you. By moving to Retropolis
              you have to be prepared to change and live by the Code. We'll guide you along the way,
              but it's a serious commitment.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="requirement">
            <h3 class="title">Commit to improve</h3>
            <p>
              Speaking of commitment, you have to know that learning to draw is really what you want.
              Our learning experience is designed to change your behavior and build habits that will optimize your
              learning. This literally means changing your life. If you are not committed to improve at drawing,
              your time would be better spent elsewhere. We don't want to do the changes to your life if you don't
              want them yourself.

              Part-time program
            </h2>
            <p>
              For students who cannot fully commit to moving to Retropolis, we offer participation through
              Retronator's Lands of Illusions alternate reality system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it is not free, it is affordable and will allow you to experience everything we have to offer
              while staying abroad. Prices start at $10—search for the Pixel Art Academy content module in
              <a href="{{routerPath 'Retronator.HQ.Adventure' parameter2='store'}}" target="_blank">Retronator Store</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The system involves creating a character that moves to Retropolis instead of you.
              With a fully immersive neural connection, you will be able to connect to them and
              influence their actions. When you're offline though, the AI will take over, making the agent
              indistinguishable from normal Retropolis visitors. As your character studies at Retropolis,
              you will learn with them.

        <h2>Admission week</h2>
        <p>
          Applying to Retropolis Academy of Art might be unlike anything you've experienced before. It is a
          test of commitment, but a test that teaches you how to pass it as well.

            <h3 class="title">Grab your PixelBoy</h3>
            <p>
              We've partnered with Retronator to distribute a PixelBoy 2000 to you for the duration of
              your admission week. Good news: if you get accepted, you keep your PixelBoy!
            </p>
            <p>
              You will use your device to check-in and report on your progress with the Journal app.
              Other organizational tools will help you achieve this task.

          <li class="step">
            <h3 class="title">Set your learning goals</h3>
            <p>
              Our program adapts to your particular wishes. During admission week you'll
              explore your motivations to draw and define your learning path. Your goals might change over time, so this is
              just somethings to start with.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            <h3 class="title">Learn the basics</h3>
            <p>
              If you are new to the world of art, you'll use the admission week to learn the ropes
              of digital drawing in the style of pixel art.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may submit your results in other
              mediums as well—it's up to you—but you'll be responsible to adjust your learning materials
              when needed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            <h3 class="title">Meet your classmates</h3>
            <p>
              You are not the only one applying to the Academy. During admissions you will introduce yourself
              and meet other applicants. Maybe you'll even make a lifelong friend.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't worry if you're shy. It's completely fine to just observe others. You can also adjust your privacy
              settings if you'd rather others don't interact with you.

          <li class="step">
            <h3 class="title">Learn the Retropolis Code</h3>
            <p>
              We don't expect you to memorize anything by heart, but you'll come across various situations
              that will assess if your values align with Retropolis Code of Behavior. If needed, you'll
              learn how to adjust and why people of Retropolis chose these values.

          <li class="step">
            <h3 class="title">Final exam</h3>
            <p>
              Just kidding. We were serious that there are no grades and exams. What you will do instead is your
              first drawing.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're completely new to this, it might be a bit stressful being thrown into
              water without learning to swim yet. Don't worry, drawing is not life threatening.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tracking your progress is an essential component of our program. Improvements are hard to see on a
              day-to-day basis, but you might be amazed at how far you've come compared to
              the start. Your first drawing will be something to look back to.

        <h2>It's up to you</h2>
        <p>
          The Academy doesn't have an admissions committee. You will set your own commitment goal and it's
          up to you to reach it. Everyone that reaches the end of admissions, passes. Your fate is really just in your hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will help you get to the end—it's our purpose after all. We will give you tools to succeed, you just need
          to take advantage of them. And if you still don't manage to make it all the way through,
          you can always come back and give it another shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be expected to keep your commitment while at the Academy, so set realistic goals. We'll still be
          here to help, but if you can't be an active member of our community, you will lose your spot. You're
          always welcome to come back, but you'll have to go through admissions again and re-assess your goals.
