  <h1>Pixel Art Academy Alpha!</h1>
  <h2>Current functionality</h2>
  <p>Here are the things you can play around with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="{{flowRouterPath 'LandsOfIllusions.PixelBoy'}}">PixelBoy 2000</a></strong>: Use your favorite mobile apps.</li>
    <li><strong>Game development storyline</strong>: Coming up next …</li>
  </ul>
  <hr/>
  <p>Things to keep in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security</strong>: Webpage is for now running over an unsecure http protocol. I you are on a public network such as a cafe
      or a dorm wi-fi,
      someone could potentially listen and hijack the communication between your browser and the server. It's unlikely,
      especially since there's no information to 'steal' yet, but I just wanted a disclaimer out there. So it's up to
      you not to store any sensitive information in there until I upgrade to https. And you probably shouldn't even later on. Otherwise all the data is safely stored to the best of my knowledge (you are welcome to
      analyze the
      <a href="https://github.com/retronator" target="_blank">source
        code</a>).
    </li>
    <li><strong>User data</strong>: I don't guarantee that any user/character data won't get wiped at some point or another during the
      alpha. Please don't use the alpha to build a portfolio to show to clients (yet). It's a playground to see the tech while it's
      being built. I will do my best to always migrate the old information to new versions, but again, a disclaimer that it's not guaranteed.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Personal information</strong>: If you're under 13 years old, you aren't allowed to create an account to use with the site. If you have
      created an account, you have agreed that you are 13 years old or older. Everything that Pixel Art Academy stores in the database are things you
      explicitly entered into the game, so include as much or little of personal information as you'd like to share with other game players.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: I don't use cookies! I store your login info and character selection to local
      storage (it stays on your computer) so you can continue without logging in again and reloading your character after you've left. I don't
      have time (or desire, for now) to bother with analytics so there are no tracking cookies and collection of
      that sort of information.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Graphics</strong>: There are no graphics! This is pure html/minimal css alpha to develop the functionality.
      After the functionality is up, then I can be bothered with styling. Kind of like Dwarf Fortress.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>By using Pixel Art Academy you are agreeing to these terms. Savvy? Good.</p>
