From Gobble Holes Down the Drain
Gobble Holes
Scoring holes in pin games were typically circular openings that captured the ball and rewarded players with points based on the difficulty of the shot.
While circles were the most common, elongated holes were capable of gobbling multiple balls at once. These unique designs included straight or curved variations, like Ballyhoo’s smile-shaped openings that followed the wider arc of the surrounding pins.
The size of the holes generally matched the ball’s dimensions, though larger ones existed for low-scoring areas. 
A prominent feature on many machines was an elongated hole at the bottom of the playfield—a catch-all that often left players empty-handed in terms of points. 
Over time, holes in the playfield got additional features such as the ability to kick the ball back into play, often transferring the ball into higher-scoring areas. Later yet, holes would be used to lock balls, accumulating them until finally unleashing a thrilling multi-ball frenzy.
Drain
After bumpers and targets took over the scoring aspects of pinball, gobble holes gradually disappeared. Only the dreaded bottom outhole, now known as the drain, remained firmly in place where the player would eventually but inevitably lose the ball.
