From Gobble Holes Down the Drain
The objective in pinball has always been to rack up as many points as you can. Before a single electrical component was added to the playfield, the game of bagatelle featured pins and holes in many variations. When Gottlieb's Baffle Ball and Bally's Ballyhoo became coin-op hits in 1931 and 1932, they set the standard for prewar pinball machines, challenging players to land the ball in differently shaped openings. The so-called gobble holes remained the main scoring mechanic until electrified bumpers propelled the game toward automatic counting of points.
Gobble Holes
The classic gobble holes are typically circular openings where the balls rest until the end of the play and contribute a score relative to the difficulty of hitting the hole. 
While circles were widely the most used shapes, elongated holes could gobble multiple balls. These holes could be straight or curved, such as Ballyhoo's smile-shaped openings that neatly followed the wider radius of the pins surrounding the opening.
The size of the opening usually matched the size of the ball, but larger openings existed for various lower-scoring areas.
A common occurrence was an elongated hole at the bottom of the playfield that served as a catch-all, often not providing any points to the player.
Drain
After bumpers and targets took over the scoring aspects of pinball, gobble holes gradually disappeared. They were occasionally replaced with more interactive kick-out (eject) holes that would hold the ball and eject it when the player reached a specific objective.
Only the dreaded bottom outhole, now known as the drain, remained firmly in place where the player would eventually but inevitably lose the ball.
