The History of Prewar Pinball Machines
Prewar Pinball Machines: The Origins of an American Icon
Before flippers sent steel balls ricocheting up a pinball playfield, early pin games lured crowds with their delicate interplay of chance and skill.

The Pin in Pinball
Ever since humans discovered the sphere shape, we've been obsessed with finding ways of shooting balls through hoops or into holes. Of special importance for pinball is the tabletop game bagatelle, brought to America by European settlers.
Bagatelle versions featured wooden pins that players navigated while aiming balls toward scoring holes. Resetting the pins must have been tedious, prompting 18th-century variants like billard japonais and stosspudel, which replaced wooden pins with fixed metal ones—essentially nails hammered into the playfield. Pool cues were replaced by the spring launcher, setting the table for pin games to evolve.
Points on the Board
When Gottlieb's Baffle Ball and Bally's Ballyhoo became coin-op hits at the start of the 1930s, the Chicago-based manufacturers set the standard for prewar pinball machines.
Pin games challenged players to shoot balls into differently shaped scoring holes. The ball launched from the shooting lane to a curved top before tumbling down the playfield. If you were unlucky, the dreaded 'out' hole was waiting for you at the bottom, yielding zero points.
To keep the designs fresh, playfields became increasingly intricate throughout the 1930s. The manufacturers transformed pinball from purely mechanical to electromechanical with innovations like bumpers and kick-out holes. Electricity also enabled the machines to keep score, removing the need for players to manually tally their points.
End of an Era
World War II marked the end of prewar pin games, as manufacturers repurposed their factories for military production. When the assembly lines returned to entertainment, the pinball landscape would change forever. The introduction of flippers in 1947 ushered in the modern age of pinball, bringing the prewar chapter to a close.
