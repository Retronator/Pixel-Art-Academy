The Electrifying Bumper

The Electrifying Bumper
Of all the parts on the pinball playfield, the modern bumpers feel the most satisfyingly unpredictable. The energy that builds up while the ball ricochets between the powerful posts is matched only by the feeling of points flooding the scoreboard.
The Pin in Pinball
Before the bumper, there was the pin. Pinball's predecessor, bagatelle, featured wooden pins that had to be either knocked down or avoided. Setting them back up must have been annoying, as the 18th-century variants known as billard japonais and stosspudel replaced these with thin, fixed metal pins, essentially nails hammered into the playfield. Watching the ball tumble down the playfield in anticipation of where it would land added an alluring luck aspect to the game. Another addictive component was bells, enhancing the dopamine kick of hitting a high-scoring target.
Passive Bumpers
At the time, players scored by landing balls into gobble holes and they had to manually count the points for a total score. All of this would change with the introduction of electricity. 
If you take a metal peg and hang a coil around it, you can detect when the ball hits it. The ball moves the coil to touch a conductive surface, closing the electric circuit and automatically increasing the score displayed on the backboard. 
Later designs changed the coil to a metal skirt that the ball rolled onto, similarly closing the scoring circuit.
Active Bumpers
One more feature was required to make the bumpers into the form we know today—the ability to forcefully kick the ball away from it.
Active bumpers are an iconic part of pinball to this day, lending their mechanical power and sound to an exhilarating gameplay experience.
