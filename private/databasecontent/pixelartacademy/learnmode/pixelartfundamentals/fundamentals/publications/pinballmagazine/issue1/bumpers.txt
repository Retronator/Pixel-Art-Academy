The Electrifying Bumper

Donald Bell
The Electrifying Bumper
Of all the parts on the pinball playfield, the modern bumpers feel the most satisfyingly unpredictable. The energy that builds up while the ball ricochets between the powerful posts is matched only by the feeling of points flooding the scoreboard.
Passive Bumpers
The first bumpers didn't bounce the ball back yet; they only detected that the ball hit them. The metal pegs employed a hanging coil that the ball moved to touch a conductive surface, closing the electric circuit and automatically increasing the score displayed on the backboard.
Later designs changed the coil to a metal skirt that the ball rolled onto, similarly closing the scoring circuit.
Active Bumpers
Of course, the bumpers we know today wouldn't be as iconic without the ability to forcefully kick the ball away from it. Their mechanical power and sound add to an exhilarating pinball experience.
