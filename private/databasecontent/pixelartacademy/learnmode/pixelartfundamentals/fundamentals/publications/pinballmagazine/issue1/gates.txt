The Pinball Gate: One Way Only
While it might not be the first component that comes to mind when thinking of pinball, the gate is usually the first the ball touches on its way to the playfield.
Gates are typically made of metal wire and designed as a simple swing-arm mechanism. They allow the ball to pass through in one direction and are commonly used to prevent the ball from re-entering the shooter lane.
In prewar pin games, the shooter lane gate was often the sole gate used, complemented by a rebound obstacle positioned on the opposite side of the top arch. 
In contrast, later machines integrated gates more seamlessly into the playfield flow. Modern wire gates not only allow the ball to pass through but also facilitate smooth movement along their edges.
The flap door design offers a popular alternative, providing a durable one-way passage that can withstand direct hits in the opposite direction.
Modern machines include gates with additional mechanisms. Some gates can be temporarily locked to prevent ball passage in certain game modes, or deactivated to create dynamic pathways.
